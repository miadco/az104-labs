# AZ-104 Lab Projects ‚Äì Personal Practice Repository

Easily my favorite Azure labs! The learning objectives were clearly defined, with a solid introduction and a real-world scenario that made the content engaging and relevant. While I still don't fully grasp Microsoft‚Äôs learning diagrams, they were included for those who do. The lab covered practical job skills, provided clear step-by-step instructions, integrated Copilot support, and offered links for continued self-paced learning. It even ended with key takeaways to reinforce the material. Excellent work ‚Äî shoutout to the creators of this outstanding content.
