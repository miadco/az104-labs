### 🧠 Reflections

I enjoyed doing the SC-300 and AZ-500 labs, but AZ-104 has been my favorite. The labs were clear, the scenarios felt real, and the experience made Azure click for me in a deeper way. Azure has an expansive ecosystem but the more you use it the more you start to understand the strategy behind it and how its services work together. Will definitely revisit, finish, and upload the rest of labs to this repository.
