## üìå Overview  
In this lab, I implemented Azure Monitor to configure alerts, action groups, and log queries. The lab focused on monitoring infrastructure changes, such as VM deletion, and sending notifications to administrators. This ensures proactive detection and response to critical events in an Azure environment.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Deploy infrastructure from an ARM template.  
- Create an alert for virtual machine deletion.  
- Configure action group notifications for operations staff.  
- Trigger and test an alert with a VM deletion.  
- Configure an alert processing rule to suppress alerts during maintenance.  
- Explore Azure Monitor log queries with KQL.

## üß† Key Concepts Reinforced  

| Concept | Description |  
|---------|-------------|  
| **Azure Monitor** | Unified platform for monitoring metrics, logs, and alerts in Azure. |  
| **Alerts** | Notifications triggered when specific conditions (signals) are met. |  
| **Action Groups** | Collections of notification preferences and actions triggered by alerts. |  
| **Activity Log** | Provides a record of subscription-level operations and changes. |  
| **Log Analytics & KQL** | Query language used to analyze telemetry and monitoring data. |  

---

## üß∞ Lab Environment & Tools  
- **Azure Portal** (https://portal.azure.com)  
- **ARM Template Deployment** (`az104-11-vm-template.json`)  
- **Azure Monitor** (Alerts, Action Groups, Logs)  
- **Log Analytics Workspace with KQL Queries**  

---

## üîß Tasks Performed  

1. **Provisioned Infrastructure**  
   - Deployed a virtual machine and supporting resources using a custom ARM template.  
   - Enabled VM Insights for monitoring.  

2. **Created an Alert**  
   - Configured an alert rule for the ‚ÄúDelete Virtual Machine‚Äù signal.  

3. **Configured Action Group Notifications**  
   - Created an action group called *AlertOpsTeam* with email notifications enabled.  

4. **Triggered and Validated Alert**  
   - Deleted the test VM to trigger the alert.  
   - Verified that email notifications and alerts were logged.  

5. **Configured Alert Processing Rule**  
   - Created a rule to suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows.  

6. **Used Log Analytics Queries**  
   - Ran queries in Azure Monitor Logs.  
   - Visualized VM metrics, including heartbeat counts and CPU utilization, using KQL.  

---

## üìà Outcome Summary  
- Successfully deployed infrastructure with monitoring enabled.  
- Implemented alerts and verified notifications through action groups.  
- Demonstrated suppression of notifications during maintenance.  
- Validated log queries for analyzing VM activity and performance.  

---

## üè¢ Business Relevance  
Monitoring is essential in cloud environments to ensure availability, security, and compliance. Azure Monitor provides the ability to:  
- Detect and respond to infrastructure issues in real time.  
- Ensure administrators are notified of significant changes.  
- Leverage KQL queries for insights into performance and security.  
- Reduce noise with suppression rules, aligning with operational best practices.
