## üìå Overview
In this lab, I explored Microsoft Azure Storage services by creating and configuring a storage account, blob containers, and file shares. I secured blob storage using access tiers, immutability policies, and Shared Access Signatures (SAS). I also tested Azure File storage and enforced network restrictions with virtual networks. These steps replicate real-world scenarios for securely managing enterprise storage solutions.

## üéØ Objectives
- Create and configure a geo-redundant storage account.  
- Secure blob containers with immutability and SAS policies.  
- Upload and manage data in Azure blob storage.  
- Create Azure File shares and test file uploads.  
- Restrict access using virtual networks and storage account firewall rules.

## üß† Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept                | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Storage Account   | Container for blobs, files, queues, and tables with unique namespace access. |
| Blob Storage            | Stores unstructured data (Binary Large Objects), like images or logs.       |
| Immutable Storage       | Write once, read many (WORM) storage, secured with time-based policies.     |
| SAS (Shared Access Signature) | Grants limited, controlled access to blob data.                     |
| Azure File Storage      | Fully managed file shares accessible via SMB and Storage Browser.          |
| Network Restrictions    | Enforcing access limits using virtual networks and service endpoints.       |

## üß∞ Lab Environment & Tools

## üîß Tasks Performed
1. **Created and configured a storage account** with Standard performance, Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), and restricted public access.  
2. **Configured networking** by disabling public access, then later enabling selected networks and adding client IP for testing.  
3. **Set up lifecycle management rule** (`Movetocool`) to automatically move blobs older than 30 days to cool storage.  
4. **Created a private blob container** (`data`) and added a **time-based immutability policy** (180 days).  
5. **Uploaded a blob file** into the container with Hot access tier and confirmed restricted public access.  
6. **Generated a SAS URL** to allow limited, temporary read-only access to the uploaded blob.  
7. **Created an Azure File share** (`share1`) and uploaded a file through Storage Browser.  
8. **Restricted network access** by associating the storage account with a virtual network and removing public IP access.  
9. Validated that storage resources were only accessible from within the configured virtual network.

## üìà Outcome Summary
By the end of this lab, I successfully provisioned and secured Azure storage resources. I implemented data lifecycle policies, immutable storage retention, SAS-based controlled access, and tested Azure File shares. Restricting access at the network level demonstrated enterprise-grade security practices.

## üè¢ Business Relevance
Enterprises rely on Azure Storage to reduce costs, enforce compliance, and secure business-critical data. This lab mirrors real-world scenarios where organizations must:  
- Enforce compliance with **immutability policies** (e.g., HIPAA, FINRA, GDPR).  
- Use **cool storage tiers** to reduce cost for infrequently accessed data.  
- Secure access to storage accounts with **SAS tokens** and **virtual networks**.  
- Leverage **Azure File shares** to migrate or replace on-premises file servers.
